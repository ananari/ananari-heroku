The bulk \n                of projects that I have worked on are language-related — I have \n                made an iOS keyboard to help type the Syloti Nagri alphabet, \n                used to write the Sylheti language, spoken in north­eastern \n                Bangladesh and India. Currently, I am working on a Sylheti \n                dic­tionary in conjunction with the Sylheti Project at SOAS \n                University of London, available for both mobile and web. \n             </p>\n             <p>\n                Apart from linguistics and programming, my biggest interests \n                are music and typography.

Lately I have been getting into \n                type design, with a particular interest in making typefaces \n                for Syloti Nagri that represent the diversity in Sylheti books, \n                as well as exercising my own creativity in making new Sylheti \n                typefaces.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Home;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/appscreenshot.009feb7a.jpg\";","import \"./SylotiKeyboard.css\";\nimport appscreenshot from './appscreenshot.jpg';\n\nfunction SylotiApp() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"right\">\n              <img src={appscreenshot} alt=\"screenshot of Syloti Keyboard app\" />\n            </div>\n            <h2>Syloti Keyboard</h2>\n            <p>\n                Syloti Keyboard is an app for writing the Syloti Nagri script, \n                used for writing the Sylheti language, which is spoken by \n                eleven million people in northeastern Bangladesh and India. \n                The earliest known work using the script comes from 1549, and \n                it was used continuously until the 20th century, when the \n                language was discouraged in writing in favour of Bengali. \n                Nowadays, it is experiencing a revitalization movement, with \n                Sylhetis both in South Asia and in the diaspora looking to \n                write Sylheti using its traditional script. Sylheti Keyboard is \n                built in Swift for iOS 12.0 and above, and provides a keyboard \n                for iOS users to be able to write Syloti Nagri on their devices. \n                You can find the link for the app on the App Store <a href=\n                \"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/syloti-keyboard/id1515279890\">here</a>.\n                For Ubuntu users, I've made a layout file available here. \n            </p>\n            <h2>For non-iOS users</h2>\n            <p>\n                If you are interested in typing Syloti Nagri on Android, Gboard \n                now has a Syloti Nagri keyboard available. In addition, there \n                are a few standalone apps on Android as well, such as <a href=\n                \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.nagrikeyboard&hl=en_US&gl=US\">\n                this one</a>, but I have not used any of them myself.
